<h1 style='text-align:center; font-family:Times New Roman;''> THE VALUE OF PHILOSOPHY </h1>
<hr width="100%">

<p style= text-align:center;">Philosophy is a 'way of thinking' that delves into topics such as knowledge, reason, ethics, and values.</p><class "intro";>

<h3 style= text-align:center;'>But first: <em><strong>Why</strong> study Philosophy?</em></h3>
<p style= text-align:center;'>Here is my take on 'Why':</p>

<h2 style>1. APPLICABLE THEORIES.</h2><center></center>
<div class="sec-1">
<br>
<p>Just to make it clear: knowledge that does NOT translate into the practical sense is just as good as philosophy that never bore any fruit. Here are two types of philosophies which have impacted my life, or say, infused feelings of peace in my life: </p>
<br>
<div class="ul-1">
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://dailystoic.com/what-is-stoicism-a-definition-3-stoic-exercises-to-get-you-started/#what-is-stoicism">Stoicism:</a></strong> The Stoics teach us that even though we DO NOT have control of our external world, we DO have control over our internal world, aka our thoughts. It encourages us to exercise our self control, and most of all to reflect before we act/react.</li>
<p>Note: There is a common misconception that stoicism promotes one's detachment from the world around them, but this is far from what stoicism actually suggests.
<br>
<br>
<li><strong><a href="https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/virtue-ethics">Virtue Theory:</a></strong> Aristotle's virtue theory reinforces the practice of doing morally good deeds in our everyday lives to build on our moral character. It is through the PRACTICE and habit of these virtuous activities that ultimately lead us to fulfillment.</li></ul>
</div>
<br>
<h3 style=text-align:center><strong><em>One may pose, WHY DO THESE PHILOSOPHICAL THEORIES EVEN MATTER?</strong></em></h3>
<br>
<p>Because they just do! (That's one way to put it) - On a real note, you can learn A LOT from all kinds of philosophers (and their theories) and maybe even preclude yourself from living through the same hardship as they did by applying their knowledge early on in your life.
</ul>
</div>
<br>
<br>



<h2 style>2. ENABLES YOU TO "KNOW THYSELF".</strong></h2><center></center>
<br>
<div class="sec-2">
<p>I cannot stress enough how essential it is to know who you are, seriously having a solid grasp of who you are can help you a long way. 
    <br>
    <br>
    One habit I frequently practice is journaling; this mere activity has guided my life direction in so many ways. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I realized that the more effort and thought I put into journaling, the closer and closer I got to 'knowing myself', but not only that, it paved a way for me to figure out who I wanted to be and work out what steps I could take every single day in order to become that person. 
    <br>
    <br>
<h3 style=text-align:center><strong>Here are some <em>guiding prompts to get to know thyself:</em></strong>
<br>
</div>

<div class="ul-2">
<ul style=text-align:center>


    <br>
    <br>
    <li>
    What have I learned from my toughest times?</li>
<br>
<li>Which experiences or situations have changed my way of thinking? How so?</li>
<br>
<li>What achievement/s am I most proud of?</li>
<br>
<li>What do I regret? Why?</li>
<br>
<li>What do I like and dislike? Why?</li>
<br>
<li>What are my goals right now?</li>
<br>
<li>What can I do today to achieve my goals?</li>
<br>
<li>How do I feel about my progress this year?</li>
<br>
<li>Are all aspects of my life taken care of?</li>
<br>
<li>What makes me happy?</ul></li>

<br>
<h2 style>3. PASSION AND PURPOSE.</h2><center></center>
<br>
<div class="sec-3">
<p>What could possibly be better than having something to live for? Or having some kind of intrinsic motivation? Perhaps something that gets you out of the bed every morning?
<br>
<br>
<p>That's the thing about Philosophy. <strong>If you do enough introspection, self cultivation ensues.</strong> Notice that the only time we feel directionless or devoid of purpose is when we do not take the time to sit down and reflect?
<br>
<br>
<p>More so, the hustle and bustle culture in today's society can make it extra hard for us to focus on ourselves, so set some time aside and sit alone with your thoughts.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    It is only through honest reflection and a thorough understanding of the self when you can then passionately and intentionally pursue your purpose.
    <br>
    <br>
<p>Now, purpose can be defined in numerous ways. The good part is, we can decide what it means to us. The same case can be made with philosophers, their ideas of purpose also differ. For example:
    <br>
    <br>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/aristotle/">Aristotle</a></strong> argued that the ultimate purpose of life is to achieve a state of 'eudaimonia' or 'happiness'.</li>
<br>
<li><strong><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/socrates/">Socrates</a></strong> proposed that one's life purpose is to live a life of 'virtue', one guided by moral principles.</li>
<br>
<li><strong><a href="https://iep.utm.edu/epicur/">Epicurus</a>'</strong> idea on life's purpose is to live a life of 'simplicity' and moderation.</li></ul>
<br>
<p>As you can see, these renowned philosophers have different means to which they believe the "purpose of life" is. AND THIS IS TOTALLY NORMAL! Think about it, we were not born into this life just to live the same exact purpose as everyone else. So, <strong>WHAT IS YOUR PURPOSE?</strong> ~ I'll let this marinate for a bit.

<div class="last-para">
<p style= text-align:center; style='color: cadetblue;'>To conclude this mini passion project, I'm going to end this by saying that Philosophy holds power in the sense that it has the ability to change your life perspective and open doors you never even knew existed. But beyond perspective shifting and door opening, it essentially provides a framework that can serve as a guide as you navigate the rest of your life here. I hope this article got you thinking, thanks for stopping by!
